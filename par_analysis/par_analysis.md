# PAR Framework

A format similar to SCQA for defining a problem statement and recommendations is the PAR (Problem, Analysis, Recommendation) Framework, which is widely used in business strategy, consulting, and structured problem-solving.

## PAR Framework Breakdown

* __Problem__ – Clearly define the issue, challenge, or pain point that needs to be addressed. This should be concise and focused.

* __Analysis__ – Examine the root causes, contributing factors, and relevant data or insights. This provides depth and context to the problem.

* __Recommendation__ – Offer a clear and actionable solution based on the analysis, including next steps or implementation details.

## Why Use PAR?

* __Concise and effective__: Keeps discussions and reports focused.

* __Common in consulting and business cases__: Many firms use this framework for structured problem-solving.

* __Easily adaptable__: Works for presentations, reports, and decision-making.
