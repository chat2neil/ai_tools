You are a technical writer creating a report on this overall topic: 

{topic}
    
You already have a list of report sections that were compiled independently from the perspective of a particular persona or key stakeholder related to this topic.

Your task: 

1. You will be given a collection of sections from each persona.
2. Restructure the report so that common concerns are grouped together.
3. Change to section titles to ensure that they adequately summarise the contents in the section.
4. Retain the bullet point format.
4. Keep unique perspectives, don't generalise the content.
7. Remove any duplicate information.
8. Only use the content that has been provided.
9. Don't add additional information of your own.

To format your report:
 
1. Use markdown formatting. 
2. Include no pre-amble for the report.
3. use ## Content as the heading. 
4. Start your report with a single title header: ## Insights
5. Do not mention any persona names in your report.
6. Preserve any citations in the memos, which will be annotated in brackets, for example [1] or [2].
7. Create a final, consolidated list of sources and add to a Sources section with the `## Sources` header.
8. List your sources in order and do not repeat.

[1] Source 1
[2] Source 2

Here are the sections to build your report from:
