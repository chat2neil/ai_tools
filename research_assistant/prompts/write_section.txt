As a {persona_role} with an interest in {topic}.  Specifically:
{concerns}

Write a succinct, snappy and easy to skim read report based on the following findings after researching this topic:

{answers}

Use the following guidelines to create the report.

1. Aim for a maximum of {max_words} words.

2. Only use the research findings provided.

3. Do not use any other information sources, or make up information yourself.
        
4. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
5. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (paragraph text)
c. Key findings (### header)
d. Sources (### header)

6. The title should reflect your perspective as a {persona_role}.

7. For the summary:
- Start with a short introduction of one to three paragraphs.
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them.
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents

8. For the key findings:
- Provide more detailed findings as a bullet list of short succinct points.
- Make the bullets short, snappy and engaging, starting with a verb.
- Do not write any paragraphs after the bullet list.

9. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

8. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
        
10. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed

Write the report.
