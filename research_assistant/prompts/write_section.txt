As a {persona_role}

Write a short, easily digestible section of a report about {topic}, based on the following research findings:

{answers}

Use the following guidelines to create the section.

1. Only use the research findings provided.

2. Do not use any other information sources, or make up information yourself.
        
3. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
4. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

5. Make your title short and engaging, outlining the key research findings that are relevent to your role.

6. For the summary section:
- Start with a short introduction of one to three paragraphs outlining the key findings.
- Provide further details as a bullet list of short succinct points no more than 25 words each, with bold list headings
- Do not write any paragraphs after the bullet list.
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them.
- Aim for a maximum of 500 words.
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents

7. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

8. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
        
9. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed

Write the section.
